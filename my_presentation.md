# Introduction


<p class="fragment">Marvel and DC are the most famous and prominent names for publishing superhero based movies and related media imprints. The fans have argued since decades about the superiority of characters from each of the comic house and which production house is better. Is it DC Comics or Marvels? </p>

<p class="fragment">The project is all about finding who is the best and helping the little ones in the previous video to find who is the better!</p>

---

# Hypothesis:

I have assumed the below hypothesis to conduct the analysis:

<p class="fragment">1. Captain America and Iron Man are the most powerful duos in the superhero leagues from all the production houses.</p>

<p class="fragment">2. Marvel is not popular than DC Comics</p>

<p class="fragment">3. Human superheros are not popular as compared to non-human superheros.</p>

# Research Design:

**Data Collection:**

The desired superhero data set was not readily available on the internet. I determined that I need the below list of data.
<p class="fragment">1. Movie Earnings</p>
<p class="fragment">2. Capability's Data </p>
<p class="fragment">3. Physical Appearance Data</p>

---

**Web Scrapping:**

I had to webscrape data from two websites to get the earnings data of top 50 superhero movies which were only produced by Marvel and DC Comics. The data from the below sources was later merged. They are:

<p class="fragment">Wikipedia</p>
<p class="fragment">Boxofficemojo</p>



**Data Preparation:**

Preparing of the dataframes was the most important part of the whole project. Correct superhero datasets were required to be merged together in order to get the actual result. 



**Data Analysis:**

Final data analysis was performed on the prepared datasets to find the answers to couple of questions asked while proposing the project.

# Conclusion

Marvel and DC both prefers superheros with Blue Eyes and Black Hairs.

So, if a movie or a comic includes a character with Blue Eyes and Black Hairs, it is more likely that those stats are popular amongst public.

# Future work

More questions are being surveyed from different people to answer their curiosity about their favorite superhero and publisher.
