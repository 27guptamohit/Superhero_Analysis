## Introduction

Marvel and DC are the most famous and prominent names for publishing superhero based movies and related media imprints. The fans have argued since decades about the superiority of characters from each of the comic house and which production house is better. Is it DC Comics or Marvels? 

The project is all about finding which one is better? 
#### Marvel or DC!

# Hypothesis:

I have assumed the below hypothesis to conduct the analysis:

1. Captain America and Iron Man are the most powerful duos in the superhero leagues from all the production houses.

2. Earnings of superhero movies are not affected by the eye color, height, weight and hair color of superheros.

3. Marvel is not popular than DC Comics.

4. Human superheros are not popular as compared to non-human superheros.
